    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Our challenge today was to create a user input that would sort the user into a
      Hogwarts house based on the number of letters in their name.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We ran into some trouble relating Wes' instructions on Canvas into the jQuery that we had started in class, so we chose to follow
      the instructions to make sure it worked for us first. We followed the code exactly, but for some reason nothing was happening on our page.
      We then got an error message, found it on Stack Overflow, and realized that we simply had a name for our button, and hadn't
      actually given it an ID. After we fixed that, everything worked fine.</p>

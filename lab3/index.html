		<h1> Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<p>This Lab focused on creating an organized file Structure
				in order to ensure that files can be linked to each other with
				ease.
		<h2> Challenges</h2>
			<p> I had started messing with my homepage last week in order
				to practice CSS so I had a lot of reworking to do today to
				make the website meet the requirements. Additionally, I had
				a lot of trouble trying to make things go where I wanted them
				to go on the webpage. Using "float" is still really confusing
				to me but in the end I felt like my webpage was looking pretty
				and organized.</p>
		
		<h2> Results</h2>
			<p>Here are two screenshots of my file structure:</p>
